# Q-Learning with Gymnasium

Welcome to my Q-learning project! For this assignment, I explored how to train a simple environment using Q-learning.

## Project Overview
The goal was to create a simple Grid World environment and train it using Q-learning. I used the popular Python package `gymnasium` to set up the environment.

## Environment Setup
Using `gymnasium`, I created a simple Grid World environment. This involved setting up the grid and defining the rules for how an agent can move within this grid.

### Q-Learning Implementation
I implemented Q-learning to train the agent in this Grid World. The process included:
- Initializing the Q-table
- Defining the learning rate and discount factor
- Training the agent through episodes
- Updating the Q-values based on the agent's actions and received rewards

## Training and Evaluation
The agent was trained to navigate the Grid World and learn the optimal policy for reaching the goal. I ran multiple episodes to ensure the agent improved over time and evaluated its performance to fine-tune the parameters.
